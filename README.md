# Manasa-and-Stones-algo
This program solves the Manasa and Stones problem by creating all possible values of the last stone when constructing a sequence with two potential differences. The program computes all combinations of applying differences 'a' and 'b' over n-1 steps, avoiding repetition with a hash set and sorting the final values.
